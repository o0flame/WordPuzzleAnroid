**Author**: Manqing Mao (Team 15)

## 1 Introduction
*Scramble Solver* is an application, which is designed for players to create, solve scrambles and record corresponding gaming statistics.


## 2 Process Description

**2.1 Identify Use Case Model**

*Description*: This activity corresponds to Inception Phase I. It asks designers to (1) identify different actors and use cases and their corresponding trigger scenarios by analyzing the requirements and (2) create a use case diagram to display all the actors and use cases with suitable connection for the system.

*Entrance Criteria*:
- Input: *Requirements Document*, which lists all requirements and functions the App is going to realize.
- Input: *UML Class Diagram*, which transforms requirements to (1) classes, (2) attributes, (3) operations, and (4) relationships.

*Exit Criteria*:

- Output: Initial *UseCaseModel.md*, which consists of a use case diagram and corresponding use case descriptions.
- Output: Initial Low-level Design in Section 3 of *DesignDocument.md*.

**2.2 Establish Architectural Design**

*Description*: This activity corresponds to Inception Phase II. This activity asks designers to design an initial architecture that describes the most crucial subsystems.

*Entrance Criteria*:
- Input: *Requirements Document*, which lists all requirements and functions the App is going to realize.
- Input: *UML Class Diagram*, which transforms requirements to (1) classes, (2) attributes, (3) operations, and (4) relationships.

*Exit Criteria*:

- Output: Initial Architectural Design in Section 2 of *DesignDocument.md*.

**2.3 Refine Use Case Model and Architectural Design**

*Description*: This activity corresponds to Elaboration Phase. This activity asks designers to (1) analyze the problem domain to get better understanding of the system and (2) establish a solid Use Case Model and architectural foundation for the application.

*Entrance Criteria*:
- Input: Initial *UseCaseModel.md*, which consists of a use case diagram and corresponding use case descriptions.
- Input: Initial Low-level Design in Section 3 of *DesignDocument.md*.
- Input: Initial Architectural Design in Section 2 of *DesignDocument.md*.

*Exit Criteria*:

- Output: Clear and solid *UseCaseModel.md*.
- Output: Clear and solid Section 3 in *DesignDocument.md*.
- Output: Clear and solid Section 2 in *DesignDocument.md*.


**2.4 Set up Design**:

*Description*:  This activity corresponds to Conctruction Phase I. This activity asks designers to (1) design the initial system for the key functions, (2) UI is drafted and (3) generate test cases so that the initial system can be tested for key functionalities.

*Entrance Criteria*:

- Input: Clear and solid *UseCaseModel.md*.
- Input: Clear and solid Section 3 in *DesignDocument.md*.
- Input: Clear and solid Section 2 in *DesignDocument.md*.

*Exit Criteria*:

- Output: All Test Cases and corresponding *TestPlan.md*.
- Output: UI Design and Section 4 in *DesignDocument.md*.
- Output: Initial system with key functions realized.

**2.5 Implement Design**:

*Description*: This activity corresponds to Conctruction Phase II. This activity asks designers to (1) add more functions to realize all requirements, (2) make the system robust by passing all test cases (3) implement the GUI mock ups for the UI and (4) create a user manual.

*Entrance Criteria*:

- Input: All Test Cases and corresponding *TestPlan.md*.
- Input: UI Design and Section 4 in *DesignDocument.md*.
- Input: Initial system with key functions realized.

*Exit Criteria*:

- Output: A system with passing test cases and meeting all requirements.
- Output: A user Manual.

**2.6 Improve Product**:

*Description*: This activity corresponds to Transition Phase. This activity asks designers to improve the system iteratively through (1) fixing bugs reported by users (2) realizing new features requests from users and (3) making the applications compatible for varied new execution environments if necessary.

*Entrance Criteria*:

- Input: *Initial Product* that is ready to be deployed to the users.

*Exit Criteria*:

- Output: *Mature Product* that is ready to use.
